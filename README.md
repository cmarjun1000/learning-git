# learning-git
# Trying out git commit -am "commit message"
# tried out the git commit --amend as well

# git diff: to check in your terminal what all changes are done in your local (same as what VS Code shows side-by-side)

# git stash, git stash pop and git stash apply
# git stash apply : alternative to git stash pop but you can apply your stash AND keep them stashed as well

# Adding this line from github directly and not from local. Doing this to pull from github in Local

# learning git revert HEAD. This basically adds another commit to the commit history and reverses whatever was committed in the previous commit

# this will be removed using git revert HEAD
